## Description

"Enough With Guards" is a plugin for [SCP: Secret Laboratory](https://www.scpsecretlaboratory.com/) that improves the balance of the game by spawning Chaos Insurgents at **Gate A** and Facility Guards at **Gate B** at the start of each round. This separation helps prevent early-game conflicts where Guards may unfairly target Class-D personnel.
